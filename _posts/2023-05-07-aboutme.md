I am Runjia Shen from Cornell University, majoring in Financial Engineering. My interest in finance grew from my undergraduate study of Computer Engineering at Purdue University. During my buy-side investment internship in an Asset Management department, I designed a Python-based monthly-position monitor of Chinese hedge fund performances. I delighted in optimizing my quantitative model by analyzing their historical records and further communicating with fund managers. I also felt gratified offering clients wise investment choices, such as pension funds, to support the general public benefit. 

Besides work and study, I love K-pop and bartending.
